**Abstract:**  
An increasing number of location-based service providers are taking the advantage of cloud computing by outsourcing their Point of Interest (POI) datasets and query services to third-party cloud service providers (CSPs), which answer various location-based queries from users on their behalf. A critical security challenge is to ensure the integrity and completeness of any query result returned by CSPs. As an important type of queries, a location-based skyline query (LBSQ) asks for the POIs not dominated by any other POI with respect to a given query position, i.e., no POI is both closer to the query position and more preferable with respect to a given numeric attribute. While there have been several recent attempts on authenticating outsourced LBSQ, none of them support the shortest path distance that is preferable to the Euclidian distance in metropolitan areas. In this paper, we tackle this open challenge by introducing AuthSkySP, a novel scheme for authenticating outsourced LBSQ under the shortest path distance, which allows the user to verify the integrity and completeness of any LBSQ result returned by an untrusted CSP. We confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed solution via detailed experimental studies using both real and synthetic datasets
